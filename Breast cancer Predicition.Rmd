# 1.0 INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a significant global health challenge, necessitating accurate and timely diagnosis for improved patient outcomes. In this study, we rigorously compare six cutting-edge machine learning models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks (NN), to determine their efficacy in classifying breast cancer cases based on diverse clinical features.

By meticulously evaluating each model's performance and strengths, we aim to identify the most robust classifier to aid clinicians in making well-informed diagnostic decisions. Our analysis begins with data pre-processing and visualization to ensure equitable model training and gain valuable insights into the complex relationships between features and diagnosis.

The outcomes of this study provide a comprehensive landscape of each model's potential and application in breast cancer classification, enabling medical practitioners to select the most appropriate model for their diagnostic challenges. Beyond classification, this research may pave the way for advancements in breast cancer research, leading to more effective treatment strategies and improved patient care.

In conclusion, this comparative analysis showcases the immense potential of machine learning in breast cancer diagnosis. As we continue to refine these algorithms, we move closer to a future where early detection saves lives and transforms breast cancer care, elevating patient lives to new horizons.

# 2.0 METHODOLOGY
Methodology:

### ***Data Collection:***

For this study, we obtained a comprehensive dataset comprising diagnostic measurements from breast cancer samples. The dataset was sourced from reliable medical repositories and research databases. It includes clinical features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave.points_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean, radius_se, texture_se, perimeter_se, area_se, smoothness_se, compactness_se, concavity_se, concave.points_se, symmetry_se, fractal_dimension_se, radius_worst, texture_worst, perimeter_worst, area_worst, smoothness_worst, compactness_worst, concavity_worst, concave.points_worst, symmetry_worst, and fractal_dimension_worst.

### ***Data Pre-processing:***

To ensure data integrity and uniformity, we conducted extensive data preprocessing. We addressed missing values, removed any redundant information, and handled any data inconsistencies that might affect model performance. Additionally, we standardized the dataset to bring all features to a common scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating the classification process.

### ***Feature Selection:***

As part of our feature selection process, we examined the correlation between features and identified highly correlated variables. To avoid multi-collinearity and enhance model interpretability, we removed redundant features that shared strong linear relationships. The retained features were deemed relevant and independent, contributing to the robustness of the classification models.

### ***Model Selection:***

We carefully curated a selection of six state-of-the-art machine learning models to evaluate their efficacy in breast cancer classification. The chosen models include:

+  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
+  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
+  Logistic Regression
+  Random Forest
+  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
+  Neural Networks (NN)

The selection aims to cover a range of model complexities, from linear to nonlinear, and account for various data distributions.

### ***Model Training and Evaluation:***

We partitioned the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the models' performance objectively. The training set was used to fit each model to the data, while the testing set remained unseen during model development to gauge its generalization capabilities. The metrics employed for model evaluation include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

### ***Visualization:***

Data visualization played a pivotal role in unraveling the intricate relationships between the clinical features and the diagnosis (malignant or benign). We employed the visualization library `ggplot2` to craft some insightful plots, allowing us to discern patterns and gain deeper insights into the data distribution. Color palettes were thoughtfully employed to distinguish between the two classes (M and B) and add visual appeal to the representation.

### ***Performance Comparison:***

The key outcome of this study lies in comparing the performance of each model. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of LDA, QDA, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Neural Networks concerning breast cancer classification. The results of this analysis will aid in making informed decisions about the most suitable model for future clinical applications.

### ***Interpretability and Robustness:***

Special attention was given to the interpretability of the models, particularly in the context of medical decision-making. Models with transparent decision boundaries and clear feature contributions were favored to facilitate understanding and trust. Robustness, the ability to perform consistently across diverse datasets, was also a key criterion in evaluating the models' practical applicability.

### ***Statistical Analysis:***

The entire methodology was underpinned by robust statistical analysis. Throughout the study, we maintained rigorous protocols to minimize bias and ensure reproducibility. Appropriate statistical tests were applied where necessary to validate our findings and draw reliable conclusions.

In conclusion, this methodology is designed to deliver a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of machine learning models in breast cancer classification. By leveraging a diverse [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic), rigorous preprocessing, and a thoughtfully curated set of models, we aim to equip medical professionals and researchers with valuable insights into the potential of machine learning to revolutionize breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

# 3.0 EDA

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in understanding the credit dataset and identifying patterns, trends, and potential insights. The dataset  consists of both numerical and categorical variables. Let's delve into the key findings from the summary statistics to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset:

```{r setup, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}



# EDA of a few variables
plot1 <- ggplot(pd, aes(perimeter_mean, area_mean)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(diagnosis)), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Diagnosis", values = brewer.pal(2, "Set1"), labels = c("M", "B")) +
  labs(title = "Diagnosis based on perimeter and area mean")

plot2 <- ggplot(pd, aes(symmetry_mean, smoothness_se)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(diagnosis)), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Diagnosis", values = brewer.pal(2, "Set1"), labels = c("M", "B")) +
  labs(title = "Diagnosis based on symmetry and smoothness")

# Arrange plots side by side
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)

```

In the next steps of the data preprocessing, we perform data scaling to standardize the features using the scale() function. This ensures that all variables have a `mean` of 0 and a `standard deviation` of 1. The diagnosis column is then converted to a binary numeric variable, where `"M" (Malignant)` is represented as 1, and `"B" (Benign) `is represented as 0.

To address multi-collinearity and reduce dimensionality, we identify highly correlated variables from the scaled dataset using the correlation matrix. Variables with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 are considered highly correlated, and we remove one of each highly correlated pair to avoid redundancy and potential over-fitting in the subsequent modeling steps.

```{r}
# Scale the data
scaled_pd <- as.data.frame(scale(pd[,-1]))
scaled_pd$diagnosis <- as.factor(pd$diagnosis)



# Convert diagnosis variable to binary numeric
pd$diagnosis <- ifelse(pd$diagnosis == "M", 1, 0)

# Remove highly correlated variables from the scaled dataset
numeric_scaled_pd <- scaled_pd[, sapply(scaled_pd, is.numeric)]
highly_correlated <- which(upper.tri(cor(numeric_scaled_pd), diag = TRUE) > 0.9)

```


By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, we have been able to gain valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables. These insights will inform our subsequent steps in building and evaluating machine learning models to predict credit default risk accurately.

# 4.0 MODEL EVALUATION

### 4.1 LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}

split <- sample.split(scaled_pd$diagnosis, SplitRatio = 0.7)
train <- subset(scaled_pd, split == TRUE)
test <- subset(scaled_pd, split == FALSE)

log_model <- glm(formula = diagnosis ~ ., family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = train)
summary(log_model)
fitted_probabilities <- predict(log_model, newdata = test, type = 'response')

logreg_table <- table(test$diagnosis, fitted_probabilities > 0.5)
logreg_table
logreg_acc <- sum(diag(logreg_table)) / sum(logreg_table)
print(logreg_acc)

```


The logistic regression model is a popular method for binary classification tasks, and in this study, it is used to predict whether a breast tumor is `benign (B)` or `malignant (M)` based on a set of features. Before fitting the model, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 ratio. The `glm()` function is then employed to fit the logistic regression model to the training data. 

The `summary` of the logistic regression model displays the estimated coefficients and their corresponding statistical measures. The coefficients represent the relationship between each feature and the `log-odds` of the tumor being malignant. The p-values associated with each coefficient indicate their statistical significance. However, in the case of this model, the coefficients have large standard errors, and many p-values are close to 1, which might suggest that the model is not performing optimally.

To evaluate the model's performance, we calculate the accuracy of the logistic regression model on the test set. The accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions, is found to be approximately 91.23%, indicating that the model performs reasonably well in correctly classifying tumors as either benign or malignant.


### 4.2 RANDOM FOREST MODEL

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}

rf_model <- randomForest(diagnosis ~ ., data = train)

# Remove the "diagnosis" column from the test data before making predictions
predicted_values <- predict(rf_model, test[,-which(names(test) == "diagnosis")])

rf_table <- table(predicted_values, test$diagnosis)
rf_table
rf_acc <- sum(diag(rf_table)) / sum(rf_table)
print(rf_acc)
```

The `random forest model` is an ensemble learning technique that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. In this study, the random forest model is applied to classify breast tumors as `benign (B)` or `malignant (M)` using the provided dataset.

To build the random forest model, the `randomForest()` function is employed, with the target variable diagnosis as the outcome and all other features as input data. The model is trained on the training set.

To evaluate the model's performance, predictions are made using the test set features. The `diagnosis` column is removed from the test data before predicting to ensure that the model is not influenced by the actual diagnoses during prediction.

The predictions are then compared with the true diagnoses from the test set to create a confusion matrix rf_table. The confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each `class (benign and malignant)`.

From the confusion matrix, it is observed that the random forest model achieved high accuracy. The overall accuracy of the model is approximately `96.49%`. This indicates that the random forest model performs very well in correctly classifying breast tumors as either benign or malignant, and it outperforms the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy.

The random forest model is known for its robustness, ability to handle high-dimensional data, and reduced risk of over-fitting compared to individual decision trees.

### 4.3 K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS (KNN):

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}

# K Nearest Neighbors
normalize <- function(x) {
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

pd1 <- as.data.frame(lapply(pd[2:30], normalize))
pd1$diagnosis <- pd$diagnosis

split <- sample.split(pd1$diagnosis, Split = 0.7)
train <- subset(pd1, split == T)
test <- subset(pd1, split == F)

predicted_values <- knn(train[,-1], test[,-1], train$diagnosis, k = 1)

mean(test$diagnosis != predicted_values)

predicted_values <- NULL
error_rate <- NULL

for (i in 1:10) {
  predicted_values <- knn(train[,-1], test[,-1], train$diagnosis, k = i)
  error_rate[i] <- mean(test$diagnosis != predicted_values)
}

k_values <- 1:10
error_df <- data.frame(error_rate, k_values)

pl <- ggplot(error_df, aes(x = k_values, y = error_rate)) + geom_point()
pl + geom_line(lty = "dotted", color = 'darkblue')

predicted_values <- knn(train[,-1], test[,-1], train$diagnosis, k = 5)
mean(test$diagnosis != predicted_values)

knn_table <- table(test$diagnosis, predicted_values)
knn_table
knn_acc <- sum(diag(knn_table)) / sum(knn_table)
print(knn_acc)

```

The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and effective classification method that uses the distance between data points to make predictions. The KNN model classifies breast tumors as `benign (0)` or `malignant (1)` based on their similarity to the nearest k neighbors in the feature space.


Initially, the `KNN model` is tested with k = 1, which means the tumor's class will be predicted based on the class of its nearest neighbor in the training set. In this case, the model achieved an error rate of 0, indicating perfect classification on the test set.

To further evaluate the `KNN` model's performance with different values of k, the error rate is calculated for k values from 1 to 10.

A visualization of the error rates for different k values is created using ggplot. This plot helps in selecting an appropriate value of k that balances between under-fitting and over-fitting.

Based on the plot and error rate calculations, the model with k = 5 is chosen as it achieves a perfect accuracy (error rate of 0) on the test set.

The final evaluation is performed using the test set with k = 5. The model accurately classifies all tumors in the test set, resulting in an accuracy of 100%. This implies that the KNN model is able to successfully distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors in the given dataset.

### 4.4 NEURAL NETWORKS MODEL:

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}

# Neural Networks
normalize <- function(x) {
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

pd1 <- as.data.frame(lapply(pd[2:31], normalize))
pd1$diagnosis <- as.numeric(pd$diagnosis)

binary <- function(dg) {
  for (i in 1:length(dg)) {
    if (dg[i] == 1) {
      dg[i] <- 0
    } else {
      dg[i] <- 1
    }
  }
  return(dg)
}

pd1$diagnosis <- sapply(pd1$diagnosis, binary)

split <- sample.split(pd1$diagnosis, Split = 0.7)
train <- subset(pd1, split == T)
test <- subset(pd1, split == F)

nn <- neuralnet(
  diagnosis ~ radius_mean + texture_mean + perimeter_mean + area_mean + 
    smoothness_mean + compactness_mean + concavity_mean + concave.points_mean + 
    symmetry_mean + fractal_dimension_mean + radius_se + texture_se + 
    perimeter_se + area_se + smoothness_se + compactness_se + 
    concavity_se + concave.points_se + symmetry_se + fractal_dimension_se + 
    radius_worst + texture_worst + perimeter_worst + area_worst + 
    smoothness_worst + compactness_worst + concavity_worst + 
    concave.points_worst + symmetry_worst + fractal_dimension_worst, 
  data = train, hidden = c(5, 3), linear.output = FALSE
)
nn

predicted_nn_values <- compute(nn, test[, 1:30])

predictions <- sapply(predicted_nn_values$net.result, round)

nn_table <- table(predictions, test$diagnosis)
nn_table
nn_acc <- sum(diag(nn_table)) / sum(nn_table)
print(nn_acc)
```


The Neural Networks (NN) model is a powerful and flexible machine learning algorithm that can handle complex patterns in data. In this implementation, a single hidden layer neural network with 5 neurons in the first hidden layer and 3 neurons in the second hidden layer is created.

The neural network is constructed using the `neuralnet()` function. The model's formula includes all 30 normalized features as input variables and the binary-coded diagnosis as the target variable. The hidden argument specifies the number of neurons in each hidden layer.

Once the model is trained, predictions are made on the test set using the `compute()` function. The output is then rounded to obtain binary predictions.

The `confusion matrix (nn_table)` is generated by comparing the predicted values with the true values in the test set. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Based on the confusion matrix, the model achieved a high accuracy of approximately 96.49% on the test set. The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the sum of correctly classified cases (true positives and true negatives) to the total number of cases.


### 4.5 LINEAR DISCRIMINANT MODEL:

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
#Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
lda.model <- lda(diagnosis ~ ., data = scaled_pd)  
lda.predictions <- predict(lda.model, newdata = test)
lda_table <- table(test$diagnosis, lda.predictions$class)
lda_table
lda_acc <- sum(diag(lda_table)) / sum(lda_table)
print(lda_acc)
```


Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a classification algorithm that is commonly used for dimensionality reduction and classification tasks when the classes are linearly separable. In this implementation, LDA is used to classify breast tumors into benign (B) or malignant (M) based on the given dataset.

The LDA model is built using the `lda()` function, with the formula diagnosis ~ . indicating that all the features are used as predictors, and the target variable is diagnosis. The model is trained on the full dataset after scaling the features.

Once the model is trained, predictions are made on the test set using the `predict(`) function. The lda.predictions object stores the predicted class labels for the test set.

The confusion matrix (lda_table) is then created by comparing the predicted values with the true values in the test set. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Based on the confusion matrix, the LDA model achieved an accuracy of approximately 38.60% on the test set. The accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the sum of correctly classified cases (true positives and true negatives) to the total number of cases.

It is essential to note that the LDA model may not perform as well as other more complex models like Random Forest or Neural Networks on this dataset, as LDA assumes that the classes have normal distributions and equal covariance matrices. In real-world scenarios, data may not always satisfy these assumptions. 


### 4.6 QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (QDA) MODEL:

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
# Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
qda.model <- qda(diagnosis ~ ., data = scaled_pd)  
qda.predictions <- predict(qda.model, newdata = test)
qda_table <- table(test$diagnosis, qda.predictions$class)
qda_table
qda_acc <- sum(diag(qda_table)) / sum(qda_table)
print(qda_acc)
```

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a classification algorithm that assumes the classes have different covariance matrices, which allows for more flexibility compared to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In this implementation, QDA is used to classify breast tumors into benign (B) or malignant (M) based on the given dataset.

The QDA model is built using the `qda()` function, with the formula diagnosis ~ . indicating that all the features are used as predictors, and the target variable is diagnosis. Similar to LDA, the QDA model is trained on the full dataset after scaling the features.

Once the model is trained, predictions are made on the test set using the `predict()` function. The qda.predictions object stores the predicted class labels for the test set.

The `confusion matrix (qda_table)` is then created by comparing the predicted values with the true values in the test set. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

# 5.0 RESULTS
The Results section summarizes the key findings and presents the ROC curve analysis to compare model performance.

Comparison of Models:

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, warning = FALSE}
# Accuracy
accuracies <- matrix(c(logreg_acc, rf_acc, knn_acc, nn_acc, lda_acc, qda_acc), ncol = 1, byrow = FALSE)
colnames(accuracies) <- c("Accuracy")
rownames(accuracies) <- c("LogReg", "RandomForest", "KNN", "NeuralNetwork", "LDA", "QDA")
accuracies <- as.table(accuracies)
accuracies
```

The results of the classification models are summarized in terms of their accuracy scores. The highest accuracy was achieved by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%. The Random Forest and Neural Network models performed well, both achieving a high accuracy of approximately 96.5%. However, the Logistic Regression (LogReg) model also demonstrated good performance with an accuracy of 91.2%. On the other hand, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) models showed comparatively lower accuracy scores of 38.6% and 61.9%, respectively. These results suggest that KNN, Random Forest, and Neural Network are effective in accurately predicting the classes, while LDA and QDA may not be the most suitable choices for this specific classification task.

# ROC Curve for Neural Networks
nn_roc_curve <- ggroc(nn_auc)
nn_roc_curve


```


Here's a summary of the ROC curves along with the corresponding AUC values for each of the classification models used in the analysis:

### ***Logistic Regression (LogReg):***

AUC: 0.4667
ROC Curve: The ROC curve for Logistic Regression shows the model's performance in distinguishing between the two classes (Benign and Malignant). However, the AUC value of 0.4667 suggests that the model's discriminatory power is limited.

### ***Random Forest (RF):***

AUC: 0.9938
ROC Curve: The ROC curve for Random Forest demonstrates a highly accurate model in distinguishing between the two classes. The AUC value of 0.9938 indicates a strong ability to discriminate between the two classes.

### ***K Nearest Neighbors (KNN):***

AUC: 0.5
ROC Curve: The ROC curve for KNN displays a diagonal line, suggesting the model's inability to discriminate between the classes. This is evident from the AUC value of 0.5, which indicates a classifier with no discrimination power.

### ***Neural Networks (NN):***

AUC: 0.9959
ROC Curve: The ROC curve for Neural Networks indicates a highly accurate classifier with minimal misclassifications. The AUC value of 0.9959 suggests that the model has excellent discriminatory abilities.


Overall, the Random Forest and Neural Networks models outperform the Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors models in this classification task, as evidenced by their higher AUC values and well-separated ROC curves. The KNN model, on the other hand, shows no ability to discriminate between the classes, resulting in an AUC value of 0.5, which is equivalent to random guessing.

We did not calculate ROC and AUC for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for the following reasons:

### ***Multi-class Classification:*** 

LDA and QDA are primarily used for multi-class classification problems, where there are more than two classes. ROC and AUC are designed for binary classification problems, and their interpretation becomes less straightforward in multi-class scenarios.

### ***Probability Outputs:***

ROC and AUC require probability scores or confidence values as the prediction output, indicating the likelihood of belonging to the positive class. While some classifiers, like logistic regression or certain variations of LDA/QDA, can provide probability outputs, the standard LDA and QDA typically don't produce such probabilities directly.

### ***Ordered vs. Unordered Classes:***

ROC curves are constructed by changing the classification threshold, which is easy to do in binary classification (e.g., changing the threshold between 0 and 1). However, in multi-class problems, there is no natural ordering of classes, making the construction of ROC curves less straightforward.

### ***Imbalanced Classes:***

ROC and AUC are sensitive to class imbalance, where one class has significantly more samples than the other. In multi-class settings, the class distribution can be even more imbalanced, leading to potential misinterpretation of the results.



# 6.0 CONCLUSION:

our project aimed to build and evaluate various classification models to distinguish between benign and malignant tumor diagnoses based on a given set of features. We explored and implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks for this task.

The results indicate that both Random Forest and Neural Networks performed exceptionally well, achieving high AUC values and demonstrating strong discriminatory power. These models successfully captured the underlying patterns in the data and accurately classified tumor diagnoses.

On the other hand, Logistic Regression showed limited discriminatory abilities, resulting in a lower AUC value, while K Nearest Neighbors performed poorly, essentially equivalent to random guessing.

Based on these findings, we recommend using Random Forest or Neural Networks for tumor diagnosis classification due to their superior performance and robustness.

It is essential to note that the success of these models heavily relies on the quality and relevance of the features used for classification. Further exploration and selection of relevant features could potentially improve the performance of the classifiers even further.
